# Kubuntu



My observations at this point are basically all about the window manager, in this case Plasma, I haven't experienced 

## Pros:
* Plasma looks great
* Lots of options bult in
    * Woobly Windows
    * Desktop Animations

## Cons
* Can't remove unused stock widgets
* Could not find good enough CPU usage, CPU clock  and  fan speed widgets (at leat for the panels)
* Tiling scripts did not work as imagined


## Notes
I had some issue where even though I have ~15gb of free ram it eats all of the swap and blocks up
